# ClassyHDF

A simple, classy C++ interface for HDF5 that aims to support more Pythonic
usage while handling resource management automatically.

The API requires no knowledge of HDF5 API and uses entirely `std::vector`
with native C++ types.

Features are a limited subset of the full HDF5 library. This is just a hobby
project, so I'll add features as needed.

Developed using the C interface to HDF5 1.12.0.
